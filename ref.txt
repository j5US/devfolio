                    I got my first computer when I was 12. At the time, I didn&apos;t know much about
                    programming, but I was captivated by games like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City
                    and Prince of Persia. While these games were a source of entertainment, I never
                    imagined that they&apos;d lay the foundation for my future in technology. My
                    initial years with a computer were more about playing games and exploring digital
                    worlds than about understanding the inner workings of computers.

                    It wasn&apos;t until I reached college that I started to realize the true potential
                    of computer science. I enrolled at the University of Engineering and Management,
                    and this is when I finally began to grasp the basics of programming. I started
                    building small projects using simple HTML and JavaScript, and it was during this
                    time that I developed my first serious project: Forkify, a recipe app that
                    integrated an external API to fetch recipe data asynchronously. To get a deeper
                    understanding, I enrolled in an Udemy course called The Complete JavaScript Course
                    by Jonas Schmedtmann. The course was a game-changer, giving me the structure and
                    knowledge I needed to enhance my skills and approach projects with more confidence.

                    By the time the COVID-19 pandemic hit, my learning had accelerated. As the world shifted
                    to online learning and remote work, I found myself with more time to focus on
                    building projects and expanding my skill set. The lockdown was a time of uncertainty,
                    but it also became an opportunity for me to dive deeper into development. During this
                    time, I worked with a team to build MÃºsica, a personalized music recommendation app
                    based on sentiment analysis. The project was a significant milestone, as it pushed me to
                    apply my understanding of development with the dynamics of working with a team.

                    After completing my undergraduate degree, I joined Chandigarh University for my Master&apos;s
                    in Computer Applications. It was here that I tackled my most ambitious project to date:
                    a 2D space game built with C++ and OpenGL. This project marked my first foray into game
                    development, and it taught me how to combine logic, design, and user interaction in a way
                    I hadn&apos;t before.

                    As I continued my studies, I sought to broaden my knowledge even further. I enrolled in
                    another course by Jonas Schmedtmann called Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete
                    Bootcamp. This course gave me a solid foundation in full-stack development, and it was
                    during this period that I built Natours, a full-stack web application. Using Node.js,
                    Express, and MongoDB, I created a travel booking platform that included user authentication,
                    payment integration, and server-side rendering with Pug. The experience was a turning point,
                    as it solidified my understanding of how backend systems and databases work together with
                    frontend technologies to create cohesive applications.

                    Looking back, the journey from gaming and curiosity to developing full-stack
                    applications has been an exhilarating and transformative one. Each project, from Forkify
                    to Natours, has been a stepping stone, expanding my skills and shaping my approach to
                    problem-solving. And while the learning never stops, I&apos;m excited about how far I&apos;ve
                    come and the challenges ahead as I continue to build and innovate in the world of technology.
